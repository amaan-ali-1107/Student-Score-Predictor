# Student Score Predictor

This project predicts **Math scores of students** using Machine Learning.  
It demonstrates a complete ML workflow: **EDA â†’ Model Training â†’ Web App â†’ Deployment**.  
A Flask web application is built to serve predictions, and the project is deployed on **Microsoft Azure** with continuous delivery from GitHub.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (3.13)

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (EDA + ML model)

- HTML, CSS (Template for UI)

- Flask (Web App)

- Azure App Service (Deployment)

- GitHub (CI/CD Integration)

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset & EDA**  
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to understand relationships, distributions, and correlations in the student dataset.  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for model training.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Built a modular pipeline for training.  
   - Used regression algorithms (via Scikit-learn) to predict student Math scores.  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².  

3. **Web Application (Flask)**  
   - Developed a simple Flask app (`app.py`) where users can input student details and receive predicted Math scores.  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed on **Azure Web App Service**.  
   - Integrated with GitHub for **Continuous Deployment (CD)**.  
   - Any changes pushed to the repository are automatically deployed on Azure.
